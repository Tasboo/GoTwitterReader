User: __apf__I think the main value of my graduate education was building a strong network of badass women in tech. Berkeley ladies are fierce https://twitter.com/femalequotient/status/1089113107522375681 …A new study finds that women who surround themselves with female-dominant circles are more likely to rise the ranks in their careers.

This is it. You finally made it to the corner office. You're the second youngest VP in your whole company (but technically the other one got his job through nepotism, so...). You've worked super hard, made sacrifices, been ruthless, and here you are, looking out on the East River

She graduated in December, and her start-date coincided with the government shutdown. This has put her in a tight spot financially. If you have temp work she can do until this mess is over, she needs the work. Web dev preferred, but she obviously is not really picky right now.

User: jessitronSoftware is not a craft.

Nor is it an art.

Nor is it engineering, or architecture, or anything we've ever before.

Even if you have technical writers, docs are a community effort. Tech writers can develop the documentation platform, set standards and mentor devs on writing (and, of course, write some amount of docs themselves), but everyone can and should contribute.

OH at #devopsdaysNYC

*****~~~~~~*****

Docs:
1) Service Overview: "Should I be reading these docs?"
2) Tutorial: "How do I do _?" prereqs, steps, identify success, what's next
3) Reference: "What are -all- my options?"
4) Troubleshooting: Solve this error message.

*****~~~~~~*****

Writing docs: yes, it's your job (as a dev) because you have this knowledge.
The trick is, know what people need out of each type of doc -

User: ashleymcnamaraNot true. Empathy is required, especially if you plan to deal with customers. If you're building without empathy you're only building for yourself.https://twitter.com/venatiodecorus/status/1088933641063931906 …Empathy is not a technical requirement. Sure it’s nice to have but teams can work without it.

*****~~~~~~*****

Hot take: Emotional intelligence is as important, if not more important than dev skills.

*sigh* okay:

Frontend dev: hard.
Backend dev: hard.
Language design: hard.
Writing docs: hard.
HTML/CSS: hard.
UI design: hard.
Communicating: hard.
Leading people: hard.
Management: hard.

It's all hard. Each one of these is an endless rabbit hole. And it's not a competition.

Hey friends  I'm doing some research on how startups could be better places to work. 

If you've ever been at a tech startup, mind completing this <5 min survey? Appreciate RTs for reach  https://goo.gl/forms/u7guS6ktk27LDLjJ3 …

OH MY GOD! This is horrible! Billionaires would be devastated! After fifty years, they’d only have...

*pounds on calculator*

$180 million dollars.

Uh...https://twitter.com/patrickruffini/status/1088618891146919936 …Don’t call Warren’s tax a 2% tax. Over 10 years it would wipe out 18% of wealth over $50M and over 50 years it would wipe out 64%. Over a billion dollars it would wipe out 27% over 10 years and 82% (!) over 50. And that’s not taking into account the returns on these assets.
